                                The <strong>Abyss</strong> is a retrovirus discovered in the
                                early 2000s. The virus spreads through fluid transmission, and
                                is estimated at having a 99.76% chance of infection. This
                                virus was isolated in the body of a fish native to the
                                Kermadec Trench east of New Zealand. Its discoverers, an
                                expedition team from the Montpellier University of Marine
                                Science, noted that the virus altered animal bodies to break

                                skeleton more capable of surviving in high pressure

                                The <strong>ancient virus</strong> is a retrovirus. Little is
                                known of its precise history before modern times, but it was
                                known to infect and mutate whales, which had developed a
                                measure of resistance to the virus. A mutant whale was frozen
                                in Alaska and preserved for three million years, partly
                                perhaps as a result of its mutations. When a research team
                                tried to examine the body, they were exposed to the virus and
                                mutated into Zombies. The outbreak was contained when the US
                                military began a Sterlization Operation in Alaska.

                                The <strong>Ebola virus</strong> is an RNA virus endemic to
                                the Ebola valley in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It
                                was discovered in Africa in 1976. Highly infectious and having
                                a mortality rate of 90%, it spawned international concern over
                                the possibility of a deadly pandemic. Umbrella Pharmaceuticals
                                was granted permission by the US government to take a sample
                                of the virus to the Arklay Laboratory for vaccine research in
                                1978, with research overseen by Dr. William Birkin and his
                                colleague Dr. Albert Wesker. Fascinated with the virus'
                                potency, Dr. Birkin extracted immuno-suppressant VP24 and VP35
                                from the virus and merged it into the genome of a modified
                                strain of Progenitor Virus present in the lab. This new virus,
                                part of the wider "t-Virus Project", was able to evade a
                                host's immune system and thus prevent the immune system
                                killing the host.

                                The <strong>Progenitor virus</strong> is a family of RNA
                                viruses. Progenitor is immensely ancient, and is suspected of
                                being hundreds of millions if not billions of years old, and
                                is considered to have both aided and hindered evolution of
                                Earth's ecology through the extremities of its resulting
                                mutations. While otherwise behaving as a typical Group VI
                                virus in the Baltimore classification, Progenitor is distinct
                                from all other viruses by being able to reverse lysis in cells
                                and revive organisms dead for considerable lengths of time.
                                Whereas other retroviruses such Human Immunodeficiency Virus
                                will target particular cells of a particular animal's body,
                                Progenitor is capable of infecting the cells of any organism,
                                whether animal, fungal, plant or bacterial. Considerable
                                research on Progenitor has been undertaken since its discovery
                                in the late 1960s, and a number of engineered strains have
                                since come into existence primarily for bioweapons research.

                                The <strong>Tyrant Virus</strong>, otherwise known as the
                                <strong>t-Virus</strong>, is the general name given to a
                                series of mutant Progenitor virus strains. <br /><br />
                                Initially developed by Umbrella Pharmaceuticals in the late
                                1960s, the primary goal of the "t-Virus Project" was to
                                effectively eliminate the need for a large-scale conventional
                                army and generate revenue to go to their eugenics program, the
                                Wesker Project. This required two things: the virus had to be
                                highly-contagious to the point of infecting an entire target
                                population and guarantee a 100% mortality rate. Such a virus
                                was impossible due to such contagions' tendencies to kill too
                                many people at once and prevent further spread.
                                <br /><br />
                                By 1978, development moved from creating a lethal,
                                highly-contagious virus to one that would mutate hosts to
                                become physically stronger and remain alive despite organ
                                failures and severe brain damage, the latter leading to
                                murderous aggression and an obsessive hunger to the state of
                                cannibalism. With the 1981 discovery of a statistical 10% of
                                any population is naturally immune, Phase 2 of the research
                                project focused on creating workarounds, and while work was
                                under way creating an improved t-Virus with 0% immunity, the
                                pioneering Arklay Laboratory team under Dr. William Birkin
                                engineered a new species of animal that would hunt down and
                                kill survivors, beginning with simple Bio-Organic Weapons such
                                as the Web Spinner, but breaking ground with the
                                genetically-chimeric Hunter α.
                                <br /><br />
                                In the mid-1980s, the t-Virus Project focused on creating
                                intelligent bio-weapons, most famously the Tyrants. After the
                                collapse of Umbrella in the early 2000s, the t-Virus became
                                available to dozens of organizations with the means to
                                finalize Umbrella's research in their own way and dominate the
                                weapon industry. Independently developed mutagens such as
                                t-Abyss were developed thanks to this.

                                <strong>a-Virus</strong>, is a genus of Progenitor virus which
                                was engineered as a bioweapon by a research team led by former
                                CIA agent Glenn Arias. A-Virus is the cause of a disease
                                similar to that of the t-Virus caused Cannibal Disease,
                                wherein infected humans - dubbed "Zombies" - experience
                                violent tendencies, increased hunger to the point of
                                cannibalism, and deterioration of cognitive function. What
                                sets this viral disease apart is the slower rate of cognitive
                                deterioration, with Zombies capable of a degree of speech and

                                family of viruses. Golgotha was developed by Umbrella USA as a
                                bioweapon to rival and surpass Tyrant Virus ("t-Virus"). The
                                two viruses, while being descended from Progenitor, are
                                totally dissimilar. Whereas t-Virus typically causes
                                relatively minor mutations in human hosts, like Zombies and
                                Tyrants, Golgotha causes such extreme genetic mutation victims
                                are no longer recognisable as human. Human t-Virus mutants are
                                almost unanimously infertile, while Golgotha's "G" mutants are
                                highly-fertile and asexually reproductive. t-Virus causes
                                necrosis of the body as a side-effect, while Golgotha is
                                capable of repairing dead cells, and even reviving the dead.
                                Because of these factors, the Golgotha is regarded as one of
                                the greatest threats to the planet if an outbreak were to
                                occur.
